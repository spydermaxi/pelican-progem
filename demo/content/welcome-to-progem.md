## A few things you should know

1. Progem is a serious adaptation of [Attila Theme](https://github.com/zutrinken/attila) by [Peter Amende](https://peteramende.de/)

2. Progem is designed to quickly get a static site up and running and allow individuals to showcase their work using Pelican static site generator.

3. The entire platform can be modified and customised to suit your needs. It's very powerful, but does require some knowledge of code.

## History of Pelican

A report the original author (Alexis Métaireau) wrote right after writing Pelican, in December 2010. Read more about it [here](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/report.html)

## Why I created Progem

As I was planning [Spydermaxi.com](https://spydermaxi.com), I came across Pelican static site generator and absolutely ❤️ it! Upon reading the documentation, I decided that creating a theme for the site would be an excellent opportunity to learn more about Pelican.

I'm not a web designer, and having attended Web development Bootcamp, and Django Bootcamp on Udemy has helped me grasp the basics of web development and web design. While researching where to start, I came across [Attila Theme](https://github.com/zutrinken/attila), and decided to adopt the theme to speed up the development process.
